    <h2>Encoding (VPU)</h2>
    <p>
        The vpu is the part of your GPU that can encode and decode video. When you are using your microphone, you are using the encoder located on your GPU to encode 
        the audio files that will be sent over the internet. The encoder makes the files smaller through algorithms, which often require special
        hardware to encode and decode. AV1 encoding, for example, is (as of 2024) the newest encoding on the market, replacing H265. AV1 encoders 
        and decoders can be found on the newer GPUs, allowing for faster encoding and decoding, but require a lot of time to decode on a older 
        GPU, which may lack the special hardware.
