    <h2>Encoding (VPU)</h2>
    <p>
        The VPU is the part of your GPU that can encode and decode video. When you are using your microphone, you are using the encoder located on your GPU to encode 
        the audio files that will be sent over the internet. The encoder makes the files smaller through algorithms, which often require special
        hardware to encode and decode. AV1 encoding, for example, is (as of 2024) the newest encoding on the market, replacing H265. AV1 encoders 
        and decoders can be found on the newer GPUs, allowing for faster encoding and decoding, but require a lot of time to decode on a older 
        GPU, which may lack the special hardware.
    </p>
    <h2>Decoding (VPU)</h2>
    <p>
        The decoder does exactly what you think it does. When you have an encoded file, such as the audio file in the previous explanation, the 
        decoder decodes the file into something that can be understood. Just like encoding, decoding may require special hardware in order to decode 
        specific file formats. If your favorite streamer has a shiny new AV1 encoder, but you don't, your computer may need to stress a little harder 
        in order to understand the file format.
    </p>
    <h2>Display Interface</h2>
    <p>
        The display interface on your GPU acts as a crucial bridge between the GPU's rendering ability and the output device. 
        These can include things such as monitors, VR headsets, and a TV. At the heart of this interface is the frame buffer, 
        a dedicated portion of the GPU's memory where pixel data for the current frame is stored. This is generated by the GPU 
        via rendering graphics, and it is the images or animations that need to be displayed on the screen. The display controller, 
        a specialized component within the GPU, manages the flow of data from the frame buffer to the display device. It 
        manages the timing of frame delivery, making sure that each frame is flowing to the display at exactly the correct 
        time to maintain smooth visuals and prevent issues like tearing or stuttering.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to managing the data flow, the display interface is responsible for handling the 
        physical connection between the GPU and the display device through various connectors like 
        HDMI, DisplayPort, or any other connector that you may be using. These connectors allow the 
        transfer of pixel data from the GPU to the display, adjusting signals as necessary to match the 
        requirements of your display device. Moreover, GPU drivers, both at the operating system level and 
        provided by GPU manufacturers, play a major role in this process. They allow for seamless compatibility 
        between the GPU and the display device, manage signal conversion when needed (such as converting digital 
        signals to analog for older monitors or projectors), and offer additional features like display scaling and 
        color correction where it is supported.
