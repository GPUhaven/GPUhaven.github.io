        Now that we have an idea and how the GPU "talks" with the rest of the system, learning how the GPU renders things should come next.
        Rendering items is (in most cases) the main purpose of the GPU. One of the reasons it was invented was to accelerate graphics, as
        integrated CPU graphics were not cutting it for some people.

        As I stated on the first page, the die of a GPU consists of thousands of cores, like the ones that you can find on a CPU. Both a 
        GPU and a CPU have cores. While a CPU has much less cores than a GPU, these cores are optimized for speed, and being general 
        purpose. These cores have an astonishing amount of complexity, and they clock in at jaw-dropping speeds. A GPU core is still 
        complex, but it is much more simple. They also clock in slower, but have numbers often in the thousands.

        There are a few types of GPU core, and they are different from company to company. For Nvidia, there are three different types 
        of GPU core. The first type is the CUDA core, which is used for any type of rendering. It is general purpose, and has amazing
        parellel computing power. AMD developed Stream Processors in order to compete with CUDA. Tensor cores, which came a fair bit 
        later, were focused on mastery of floating bit integers, and things of that such. Each Tensor cores consists of a 4X4 processing
        matrix.
