        Now that we have an idea and how the GPU "talks" with the rest of the system, learning how the GPU renders things should come next.
        Rendering items is (in most cases) the main purpose of the GPU. One of the reasons it was invented was to accelerate graphics, as
        integrated CPU graphics were not cutting it for some people.

    <p>
        As I stated on the first page, the die of a GPU consists of thousands of cores, like the ones that you can find on a CPU. Both a 
        GPU and a CPU have cores. While a CPU has much less cores than a GPU, these cores are optimized for speed, and being general 
        purpose. These cores have an astonishing amount of complexity, and they clock in at jaw-dropping speeds. A GPU core is still 
        complex, but it is much more simple. They also clock in slower, but have numbers often in the thousands.

    <p>
        There are a few types of GPU core, and they are different from company to company. For Nvidia, there are three different types 
        of GPU core. The first type is the CUDA core, which is used for any type of rendering. It is general purpose, and has amazing
        parellel computing power. AMD developed Stream Processors in order to compete with CUDA. Tensor cores, which came a fair bit 
        later, were focused on mastery of floating bit integers, and things of that such. Each Tensor cores consists of a 4X4 processing
        matrix, and requires a lot of knowledge to write code for.
    </p>
    <p>I will be using Nvidia's cores as examples, as AMD does have counterparts, but lacks market share at the moment.</p>
    <p>
        When you take a look at a GPU's specs, you can see that the number of CUDA cores is often one of the highest, if not the 
        highest, numbers on the page. These numbers reflect the significance of CUDA, which can enabling calculations at large scales 
        and high speeds. Contrary to the idea of instructions starting at the "beginning" (the top of the core in the diagram) of the core, instructions in a CUDA core 
        can run concurrently, thanks to the dispatch port, which provides instructions to the core. Moreover, modern GPU architectures 
        leverage mechanisms like instruction pipelining and instruction-level parallelism to overlap instruction execution with data 
        fetching, minimizing idle time. The core then proceeds to fetch necessary input data from memory or registers before executing 
        the command from the dispatch port. Subsequently, the core determines whether to utilize the FPU (floating point unit) or the 
        INTU (integer unit) for processing from the instructions that it recived. Following computation, the core transfers the result to the result queue and awaits new 
        instructions.
