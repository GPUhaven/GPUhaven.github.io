    <p>Before you start reading, I have made a few assuptions.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You know what a GPU is.</li>
        <li>You the two main GPU companies (and the upcoming little 3rd one)</li>
        <li>You know how a CPU works. If you don't, read <a href="https://cpu.land">this website.</a> Please note, I have no ties with this.</li>

    <h3>Short Review</h3>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>Some people may ask, "why do you need a GPU? My integrated graphics are perfectly OK!" To that,
         I say leave this website, go to Youtube, and open some benchmarks on your integrated graphics. Now take those, and compare them to the benchmarks of the RTX 3060.
        Yes, as of 2024, this thing is 3 years old, but it will still probably stamp on whatever APU you are using.
    </p>
    <h3>Why not?</h3>
    <p>Although GPUs provide a major benifit in any graphics-realated task, they can be pricey. A dedicated GPU also exhausts heat, and some of the higher end ones can draw upwards
        of 450 watts of power, requiring heavy cooling. Some cases can't even hold some of these cards, so you might need to purchase a whole new case.
    </p>
    <h4>CPU v. GPU</h4>
    <p>To understand the difference, expand the names of the abbreviations. CPU stands for "centeral processing unit." Now look at the first word, "centeral." A CPU is more general,
       and it does more things than a GPU. Expanding the term "GPU," we get "graphics processing unit." Now look at the first word. A GPU is more focused on graphics, and it does it 
       well.  
    </p>
    <p>If you want an easier way to remember the difference between the two, here is an analogy. Your CPU is a Toyota Carolla. It can take you anywhere you need, and it is 
        very realiable. It does almost anything you need it to do, and well. A GPU, on the other hand, is a rocket ship. It can take you to the moon, but can it get your groceries?
