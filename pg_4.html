    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The GMC (Graphics Memory Controller) within a GPU serves as a component responsible for 
        managing the flow of data between the cores of the GPU and its dedicated memory, often 
        referred to as Video RAM (VRAM). The GMC optimizes memory access and allocation, ensuring 
        that the GPU efficiently utilizes its memory resources to store and manipulate graphics 
        data. The GPU relies on VRAM to store textures, shaders, frame buffers, and other assets 
        needed for rendering images and animations. VRAM is often the limit to what your GPU can 
        render, as the more VRAM you have, the higher the resolution you can render. The GMC plays 
        a crucial role in the read and write operations to and from VRAM, and optimizing data 
        transfers with precision to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

    <h2>Functions and Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        One of the primary functions of the GMC is memory arbitration, which involves prioritizing 
        memory requests from places inside the GPU. By properly scheduling memory accesses, the GMC 
        prevents bottlenecks and optimizes the GPU's overall performance. Additionally, the GMC 
        manages memory readability, making sure that data stored in different caches within the 
        GPU remains consistent and up-to-date. This is vital for maintaining the integrity of 
        rendered images and avoiding artifacts or visual glitches.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this, the GMC often incorporates advanced memory management techniques, such as memory 
        compression and virtual memory mapping, to help with memory bandwidth utilization and overall 
        efficiency. These techniques help mitigate the limitations imposed by the finite bandwidth of 
        the memory interface, allowing the GPU to handle increasingly complex graphics workloads with 
        ease. Thus, the Graphics Memory Controller serves as a vital component of the GPU's architecture, 
        optimizing memory access and utilization to support the demanding requirements of modern graphics 
        rendering and computation.
