  <h1>How GPU Talk with the Other Parts of your Computer</h1>
    <h2>Insert canva diagram here when I do it</h2>
    <h2>(Thats going to be in a while)</h2>
    <p>To put it simply, the way you GPU talks with the rest of your computer is with the PCIe bus and lane. The PCIe bus, whichcan curently range
    from 128 bits (on a very budget card, or if you are an Nvidia fan, on mid-range cards), to 384 bits for the top end cards. </p>
    <p>Although your PCIe bus width can be very important, there is another thing that you need to consider when you think of the 
    interaction between GPU and the rest of the system. That very special mechanic is your PCIe lanes. </p>
    <p>PCIe lane count can range from the very basic X1 slot, to the X16 slot which is most commonly used for graphics. X4 is used for NVME 
     SSDs, and X8 is for the weaker GPUs that you can find on the market. Each lane, which is 16 in the X16 PCIe scenario, has 2 wires. 
    One of the wires are dedicated to the inbound traffic, and the other one is dedicated for outband traffic, which has double the 
    bandwidth.</p>
