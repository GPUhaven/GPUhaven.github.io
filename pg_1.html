  <h1>How Your GPU Talks with the Other Parts of your Computer</h1>

    <p>
        To put it simply, the way you GPU talks with the rest of your computer is with the PCIe bus and lane. 
        The PCIe bus, whichcan curently range from 128 bits (on a very budget card, or if you are an Nvidia fan, 
        on mid-range cards), to 384 bits for the top end cards. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although your PCIe bus width can be very important, there is another thing that you need to consider when you think of the 
        interaction between GPU and the rest of the system. That very special mechanic is your PCIe lanes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        PCIe lane count can range from the very basic X1 slot, to the X16 slot which is most commonly used for 
        graphics. X4 is used for NVME SSDs, and X8 is for the weaker GPUs that you can find on the market. 
        Each lane, which is 16 in the X16 PCIe scenario, has 2 wires. One of the wires are dedicated to the inbound 
        traffic, and the other one is dedicated for outband traffic, which has double the
        bandwidth.
    </p>
    <h2>Layers To PCIe</h2>
    <p>*If you don't know what they are, Packets are pieces of information!</p>
    <p>
        The Physical Layer, also known as the Big Negotiation Layer, is the layer responsible for negotiation of terms and 
        conditions with the rest of the machine. The Physical Layer recives things such as raw packets, and tells the 
        sysetm things such as the maximum bandwith the GPU can handle. Packets that are recived here are coming from other 
        PCIe devices or the system, such as the DRAM that the CPU has, and are put inside a frame. There is a single 
        byte at the beggining and the end of each "frame of packets," which states the start and the end of each frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next layer, known as the Data Link Layer (I will be using DLL for ease of understanding) is the 
        layer that decodes the mess of packets that was send in the Physical Layer. This layer does a few things, aside from 
        decoding the Physical Layer. After reciving the packets from the Phyical Layer, it sends a Transistion Layer 
        Packet, which is closed by an LCRC (Local Cyclic Reduncancy Check), and is used to check the Transistion 
        Layer Packet, which is the actual information, for its integtity. If the LCRC is good enough, then the 
        DLL sends an ACK (an ACKnowledge) signal to the emitter via the Physical Layer. If the data is 
        messes up in any way, it sends a NAK (Not AcKnowledge) signal to the emjitter which will resend the frame that 
        lines up with the sequence number, and asks it to try again. This part handles the replay buffer on the reciver 
        side.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Transaction Layer, which comes after the DLL, is responsible for managing the actual payload. The payload 
        consists of a header*, and the data that needs to be sent. The Transaction Layer also could digest the ECRC 
        (End to End Cyclic Redundancy Check). This Transistion Layer packet is coming from the Data link layer, where 
        is has been decapsulated. After this, a data check will be done if it is needed or requested. 
        This will check the logic, and make sure that there is no packet corruption when passing data fron the DLL 
        to this layer.
    </p>
    <p>*The header is describing the type of transaction such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory Transaction</li>
        <li>I/O Transaction</li>
        <li>Configuration Transaction</li>
        <li>Message Transaction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The role of the Application Layer, which is the last and final layer,
        is to handle the User Logic. This layer is sending the Header and the data payload to the Transaction Layer. 
        The magic happens in this layer where data in rooted to different hardware components.
