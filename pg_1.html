  <h1>How GPU Talk with the Other Parts of your Computer</h1>
    <h2>Insert canva diagram here when I do it</h2>
    <h2>(Thats going to be in a while)</h2>
    <p>To put it simply, the way you GPU talks with the rest of your computer is with the PCIe bus and lane. The PCIe bus, whichcan curently range
    from 128 bits (on a very budget card, or if you are an Nvidia fan, on mid-range cards), to 384 bits for the top end cards. </p>
    <p>Although your PCIe bus width can be very important, there is another thing that you need to consider when you think of the 
    interaction between GPU and the rest of the system. That very special mechanic is your PCIe lanes. </p>
    <p>PCIe lane count can range from the very basic X1 slot, to the X16 slot which is most commonly used for graphics. X4 is used for NVME 
     SSDs, and X8 is for the weaker GPUs that you can find on the market. Each lane, which is 16 in the X16 PCIe scenario, has 2 wires. 
    One of the wires are dedicated to the inbound traffic, and the other one is dedicated for outband traffic, which has double the 
    bandwidth.</p>
    <h2>Layers To PCIe</h2>
    <p>The Physical Layer, also known as the Big negotiation layer, is the layer responsible for negotiation of terms and 
        conditions with the rest of the machice. The Physical Layer recives things such as raw packets, and tells the 
        sysetm things like the maximum bandwith the GPU can handle. Packets that are recived here are coming from other 
        PCIe devices or the system, such as the DRAM that the CPU has, and are put inside a frame. There is a single 
        byte at the beggining and the end of each "fram of packets," which states the start and the end of each frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next layer, known as the Data Link Layer Packet (I will be using DLLP for ease of understanding) is the 
        layer that decodes the mess that was send in the Physical Layer. This layer does a few things, aside from 
        decoding the Physical Layer. After reciving the packets from the Phyical Layer, it sends a Traansistion Layer 
        Packet, which is closed by an LCRC (Local Cyclic Reduncancy Check), and is used to check the Transistion 
        Layer Packet, which is the actual information, for its integtity. If the LCRC is good enough,
